# MyStore

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.6.


## **Description**
This is just the frontend part of an e-commerce website using Angular. The website fetches data from a [json file](src/assets/data.json), and renders it  to the UI seamlessly for user manipulation. The `data.json` file is a stand-in for the actual API that would fetch real-time data from the database.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
